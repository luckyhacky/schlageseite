# downloader for heise.de Schlagseite

heise.de is a german site for computer news. They provide a magazine with a comic page in it. This comic is named "Schlagseite".
I used to keep the pages out of the magazine for storing. But they are yellowing, so I decided to keep them digitally on my disc.
The script will download the image and the free pdf they provide.
  
  
usage:
`./python3 beatthepage.py`
  
  
*hint: "Schlagseite" is german. 
"beat the page" is directly translated, which is no correct but I like it because it has double meaning.*



Alternate version is available on branch "schlagseite" provided by Thomas Ochs - thanks for contribution
